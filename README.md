# 🎯 Zambeel-Sniper

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to **Zambeel-Sniper** — a cheeky little Selenium-powered tool that "snipes" university courses the moment they become available. Yeah, it’s as cool as it sounds.

---

## 🚀 What's the deal?

So here’s the story:

At my university, getting into the courses you actually *wanted* was like trying to buy concert tickets during a flash sale. Absolute chaos. There were these fixed appointment slots for course registration, and if you weren’t lightning-fast (or lucky), you were out of luck.

Some folks even started hoarding courses to **trade or sell** them later during the add-drop period. 😬  
Yep, backroom deals and late-night drop-add swaps were the norm.

**Enter Zambeel-Sniper.**  
This app keeps an eye out for the course you want and *snipes* it the moment someone drops it — no sleep lost, no stress, and definitely no shady deals.

## 💻 How it works

- Built using **Python**, **Selenium**, and **PyQt5**
- Runs in the background and monitors your selected course(s)
- As soon as a course slot opens, it **auto-grabs** it before anyone else can
- Basically acts like a ninja, but for course enrollment 🥷🎓

---

## 🔥 Real-world stats

- ✅ **98%+ success rate**
- 👨‍🎓 **40+ students used it**
- 💤 Most snipes happened at night (best time to avoid competition)
- 🔐 Distributed as a **standalone installer** with **keygen-based licensing** (no piracy allowed, sorry not sorry 😎)

## 📦 Tech stack

- `Python`
- `Selenium`
- `PyQt5`
- `Custom Keygen System`

## 🧠 Why it matters

This wasn’t just about getting the right class — it was about fighting the system that made students stress, hustle, and sometimes even pay *just* to get into a class. Zambeel-Sniper was a tiny rebellion... and it worked.
